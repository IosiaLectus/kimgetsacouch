Kim is a native Texan. Josiah is an Okie. Somehow they make it work except during UT vs. OSU football game days.

One thing Kim and Josiah share in common is their love for academics, aka they are two nerds in a pod. On May 2019, Kim graduated with her second degree from The University of Texas at Austin with a master’s degree in information studies. She is currently a customer success support analyst for TrustRadius, a local B2B startup.

Josiah is in the process of earning his doctorate in physics from The University of Texas at Austin. At the moment, he has four published papers. For the upcoming school year, he will be applying to various post-doctorate positions and exploring jobs in tech. And yes, Kim has successfully influenced Josiah to own and wear a burnt orange longhorn t-shirt but has yet to get him to make the hook ‘em horns hand gesture. That’s her next goal after the wedding planning.

During their free time, the couple can be found trying new taco joints, enjoying a new-to-them happy hour, hanging out with their close friends, watching MasterChef Junior, or trying out new recipes.
