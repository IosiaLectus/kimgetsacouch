Kim is a native Texan. Josiah is an Okie. Somehow they make it work except during UT vs. OSU game days.


On May 2019, Kim graduated with her second degree from The University of Texas at Austin with a Masterâ€™s degree in information studies. She is currently applying to various jobs, so hopefully, she gets a job offer soon. As she continues to apply to jobs, she works as a coffee barista at Central Market.


Josiah is in the process of earning his doctorate in physics from The University of Texas at Austin. At the moment, he has four published papers. For the upcoming school year, he will be applying to various post-doctorate positions as well as a few jobs in tech.


During their free time, the couple can be found trying new tacos, enjoying a new-to-them happy hour, hanging out with their close friends, watching Masterchef Junior, or trying out new recipes.
