Beginnings
No love story starts with salads. It starts with a margarita pitcher from Polvo’s.


As much as Kim complains about Central Market, it is actually one of her favorite places in Austin. One day after work, she was looking for a sandwich as she felt too lazy to cook. She accidentally bumps into a tall man with long hair and glasses.


She apologizes, and he starts to make small talk with her. And this is where their stories are different. Josiah argues that he asked for her number. Kim disagrees; she gave him her number.


But the story doesn’t matter because he eventually asked her out on a date after a few days of talking over the phone (to Kim’s dismay).


Kim and Josiah were supposed to go on a date on Oct. 9 until Kim remembered that it was Rebecca’s (her roommate and future MOH) birthday celebration that night. She apologized to Josiah hoping that he wouldn’t be mad. He wasn’t. He said that the following week should be fine as long as Kim didn’t have another friend celebrating their birthday that weekend.


For Rebecca’s celebrations, their friend group went to Polvo’s eat and order margarita pitchers in the honor of the birthday girl. They talked. They laughed. And more margaritas were served.


Kim found herself texting Josiah and eventually decided to take the bullet. She asked the birthday girl if Josiah could join them on West 6th Street. Rebecca said yes.


After a bit of bar hopping, Josiah meets Kim, Rebecca and the rest of their friends at the Ranch, a three-story bar. Josiah was awkward in meeting Kim and her friends, but it got less and less awkward as the night went on. They talked, laughed, danced and enjoyed the night. When the clock struck 2 a.m., he walked the group to their friend Cris’ car who was the designated driver, and then went home.


The next day Kim and Rebecca were supposed to go to Plucker’s for Rebecca’s free meal, but she wanted to catch up on her sleep. Kim invited Josiah to take a walk, where they opened up completely on their fears, inspirations, and even about their family.


And since that day, Kim and Josiah became inseperable all thanks to Rebecca saying yes to a stranger crashing her birthday celebrations.[a]
Kim & Josiah
Kim is a native Texan. Josiah is an Okie. Somehow they make it work except during UT vs. OSU game days.


On May 2019, Kim graduated with her second degree from The University of Texas at Austin with a Master’s degree in information studies. She is currently applying to various jobs, so hopefully, she gets a job offer soon. As she continues to apply to jobs, she works as a coffee barista at Central Market.


Josiah is in the process of earning his doctorate in physics from The University of Texas at Austin. At the moment, he has four published papers. For the upcoming school year, he will be applying to various post-doctorate positions as well as a few jobs in tech.


During their free time, the couple can be found trying new tacos, enjoying a new-to-them happy hour, hanging out with their close friends, watching Masterchef Junior, or trying out new recipes.


Proposal
Kim had always wanted to go to New York City, so when Josiah asked her to visit before his 2-week Princeton summer school session, she was conflicted. She was worried about the state of my financials, her anxiety towards flying, and whether she would get the days off.


“Let’s do it,” she told Josiah.


And on July 12, Kim’s mom, Kim’s brother, Josiah and herself were en route to Newark, New Jersey.


One place Kim really wanted to visit was The Highline due to its gorgeous views of the skyline and water. In Kim fashion, she made everyone dress nicely so they could take good shots.


The sun was beginning to set when they arrived, so they tried to find a spot where they could see it. Photos began to be taken of themselves and the gorgeous sunset. As it got dark, they got ready to head out.


Kim sat down, exhausted from the walk.


“Let’s sit here,” Kim’s mom said. “I like the view better here!”


Not one to ignore her mother, Kim moved.


“Let’s take a picture?” asked Josiah as he sat down next to Kim. Kim’s mom volunteered to take the photo.


As Kim began to smile, Josiah started to scheme. He tapped Kim’s shoulder, and Kim turned around, ready to come up with a witty response. Instead, she ended up being face-to-face with a gorgeous white gold engagement ring with an aquamarine stone. The exact one Kim had playfully showed him many months prior.


“YES!” yelled Kim, without even letting Josiah ask the question. A small group of people had surrounded them and began to applaud. Tears began to fall from Kim’s face as she kissed her new fiance.


“At least let me ask the question. Wait, when did you get the ring on?” asked Josiah as she admired her new shiny accessory.
They stayed at the High Line for a while, taking a lot of photos with the engagement ring, especially after Kim realized that she had the ring on the wrong hand. Tears kept falling, smiles kept getting bigger, and Kim and Josiah could not have been happier.


And on that same night, #KimGetsACouch was official.
