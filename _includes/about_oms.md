#### Olivia Suarez

Olivia and Kim met at the University of Texas at Austin freshman year in an advertising class. Both journalism majors, Olivia and Kim shared a love for celebrity culture and got involved in Sneak Peek, the university's entertainment news program. Together they worked red carpets at events like the South by Southwest Festival and tracked down some of their favorite celebrities. Olivia is always at the ready when Kim needs a shoulder to cry on or vent to, and she credits Kim for her well-rounded knowledge of alcohol.
