Here is some information on getting around the Rio Grande Valley and things to do in the area.

## Hotel

We suggest that you stay at the venue, namely [Schlitterbahn Resort South Padre Island](https://www.schlitterbahn.com/south-padre-island/resort) (address: 100 Padre Blvd, South Padre Island, TX 78597). There are however many other hotels on the Island. You can also try [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/s/South-Padre-Island--TX--United-States/homes?refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&click_referer=t%3ASEE_ALL%7Csid%3Aff3f7ec2-3c29-4c3d-a0bf-e0b29acc6c92%7Cst%3ALANDING_PAGE_MARQUEE&title_type=NONE&place_id=ChIJ761vtJupb4YRIrPbw1yyW00&s_tag=fZUrlnjO&checkin=2020-02-21&checkout=2020-02-23).

## Airports

The Rio Grande Valley is served by three airports: The Brownsville South Padre Island Airport (BRO), the McAllen-Miller International Airport (MFE), and the Valley International Airport (HRL) in Harlingen. HRL is generally the cheapest option. HRL and BRO both have shuttles to SPI, and one can also take an Uber or Lyft (see below).

## Ground Transportation

Uber and Lyft should both be available.

There are a number of things to do in and around the RGV. Here are a few examples
