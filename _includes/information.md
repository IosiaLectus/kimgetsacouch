Here is some information on getting around the Rio Grande Valley and things to do in the area:

## Hotel

We suggest that you stay at the venue, namely [Beach Resort at South Padre Island](http://beachresortspi.com/) (address: 100 Padre Blvd, South Padre Island, TX 78597).  There are however many other hotels on the Island. You can also try [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/s/South-Padre-Island--TX--United-States/homes?refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&click_referer=t%3ASEE_ALL%7Csid%3Aff3f7ec2-3c29-4c3d-a0bf-e0b29acc6c92%7Cst%3ALANDING_PAGE_MARQUEE&title_type=NONE&place_id=ChIJ761vtJupb4YRIrPbw1yyW00&s_tag=fZUrlnjO&checkin=2020-02-21&checkout=2020-02-23). If you choose to stay at the venue, we have a block discount, which may be utilized by calling 956-426-9066 and asking to reserve under the Couch-Carmona wedding block. As the wedding is during 'Winter Texan' season, we would recommend reserving a room as early as possible.

## Airports

The Rio Grande Valley is served by three airports:
- The Brownsville South Padre Island Airport (BRO)
- The McAllen-Miller International Airport (MFE)
- The Valley International Airport (HRL) in Harlingen, TX

Kim Tip: Harlingen tends to be the cheapest option when flying into the Rio Grande Valley.

## Ground Transportation

Uber and Lyft are available. The airports also offer shuttle service to the island. Please check out costs and drop-off locations prior to reserving a shuttle.

Once in the island, you can rent golf carts and bikes to get around.
