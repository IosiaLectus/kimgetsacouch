Kim had always wanted to go to New York City, so when Josiah asked her to visit before his 2-week Princeton summer school session, she was conflicted. She was worried about the state of her financials, her anxiety towards flying, and whether she would get the days off.

“Let’s do it,” she told Josiah.

And on July 12, Kim’s mom, Kim’s brother, Josiah and herself were en route to Newark, New Jersey.

One place Kim really wanted to visit was The High Line due to its’ gorgeous views of the skyline and water. In Kim fashion, she made everyone dress nicely so they could take good photos.

As soon as they arrived, they found the perfect spot to watch the gorgeous sunset and take photos. Exhausted from the long walk, Kim sat down.
