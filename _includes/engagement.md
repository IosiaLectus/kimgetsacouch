Kim had always wanted to go to New York City, so when Josiah asked her to visit before his 2-week Princeton summer school session, she was conflicted. She was worried about the state of my financials, her anxiety towards flying, and whether she would get the days off.


“Let’s do it,” she told Josiah.


And on July 12, Kim’s mom, Kim’s brother, Josiah and herself were en route to Newark, New Jersey.


One place Kim really wanted to visit was The Highline due to its gorgeous views of the skyline and water. In Kim fashion, she made everyone dress nicely so they could take good shots.


The sun was beginning to set when they arrived, so they tried to find a spot where they could see it. Photos began to be taken of themselves and the gorgeous sunset. As it got dark, they got ready to head out.


Kim sat down, exhausted from the walk.


“Let’s sit here,” Kim’s mom said. “I like the view better here!”


Not one to ignore her mother, Kim moved.


“Let’s take a picture?” asked Josiah as he sat down next to Kim. Kim’s mom volunteered to take the photo.


As Kim began to smile, Josiah started to scheme. He tapped Kim’s shoulder, and Kim turned around, ready to come up with a witty response. Instead, she ended up being face-to-face with a gorgeous white gold engagement ring with an aquamarine stone. The exact one Kim had playfully showed him many months prior.


“YES!” yelled Kim, without even letting Josiah ask the question. A small group of people had surrounded them and began to applaud. Tears began to fall from Kim’s face as she kissed her new fiance.


“At least let me ask the question. Wait, when did you get the ring on?” asked Josiah as she admired her new shiny accessory.
They stayed at the High Line for a while, taking a lot of photos with the engagement ring, especially after Kim realized that she had the ring on the wrong hand. Tears kept falling, smiles kept getting bigger, and Kim and Josiah could not have been happier.


And on that same night, #KimGetsACouch was official.
