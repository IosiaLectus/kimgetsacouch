#### Rebecca Salazar - Maid of Honor

Rebecca met Kim on the first day of their freshman year at the University of Texas at Austin. Sharing their love of buffalo chicken pizza, live music, and dorm room dance parties it was a friendship match made in heaven. Through the years, Rebecca has been Kimâ€™s go-to person for career, life, fashion, and love advice. She knew once Rebecca gave her the stamp of approval on her relationship with Josiah that he was the one for life!
