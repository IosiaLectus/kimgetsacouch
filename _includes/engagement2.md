“Let’s sit here,” Kim’s mom said. “I like the view better here!”

Not one to ignore her mother, Kim moved.

“Let’s take a picture?” asked Josiah as he sat down next to Kim. Kim’s mom volunteered to take the photo.

As Kim began to smile, Josiah started to scheme. He tapped Kim’s shoulder, and Kim turned around and was face-to-face with a gorgeous white gold engagement ring with an aquamarine stone.

“YES!” yelled Kim, without even letting Josiah pop the question. A group of people began to surround them and applaud. Tears began to fall from Kim’s face as she kissed her new fiancé.

“At least let me ask the question. Wait, when did you get the ring on?” asked Josiah as she admired her shiny new accessory.

They stayed at the High Line for a while, taking a lot of photos with the engagement ring, especially after Kim realized that she had the ring on the wrong hand. Tears kept falling, smiles kept getting bigger, and Kim and Josiah could not have been happier.

And on that same night, #KimGetsACouch was official.
