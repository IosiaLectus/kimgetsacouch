You can find a lot of things at Central Market, organic chocolate, coffee, and the love of your life, apparently. That was the case for Kim and Josiah.

As Kim was shopping for lunch one day, she bumped into the man who would change her life forever (spoiler alert).

After some small talk, Kim and Josiah exchanged numbers and were on their way. After some back and forth texting, Josiah was eager to take Kim out for margaritas (her favorite beverage, obviously), but she was too busy getting ready for her best friend, Rebecca’s birthday celebration that weekend.

The stars didn’t seem to be aligning for these two to hang out as soon as they would’ve liked, but Kim knew this was a chance she had to take. She asked her best friend if Josiah could join the festivities, and to her surprise, Rebecca said yes!

Josiah joined Kim and her entire friend group for drinks and dancing on West 6th Street. The chemistry between the two was instant, and everyone kept asking them how long they had been dating not knowing this was their first (unofficial) date. Kim loved Josiah’s confidence on the dance floor and had an amazing time dancing the night away.

The next day, Kim invited Josiah to take a walk around her neighborhood to get to know each other without the heavy bass booming in the background. They walked for a few hours, talking about their goals, fears, and families. They both knew this connection was something special.

It’s almost hard to believe that a trip to the grocery store, crashing a birthday celebration, and a night full of dancing could lead to this, but they’ve been inseparable ever since.
