No love story starts with salads. It starts with a margarita pitcher from Polvo’s.

As much as Kim complains about Central Market, it is actually one of her favorite places in Austin. One day after work, she was looking for a sandwich as she felt too lazy to cook. She accidentally bumps into a tall man with long hair and glasses.


She apologizes, and he starts to make small talk with her. And this is where their stories are different. Josiah argues that he asked for her number. Kim disagrees; she gave him her number.


But the story doesn’t matter because he eventually asked her out on a date after a few days of talking over the phone (to Kim’s dismay).


Kim and Josiah were supposed to go on a date on Oct. 9 until Kim remembered that it was Rebecca’s (her roommate and future MOH) birthday celebration that night. She apologized to Josiah hoping that he wouldn’t be mad. He wasn’t. He said that the following week should be fine as long as Kim didn’t have another friend celebrating their birthday that weekend.


For Rebecca’s celebrations, their friend group went to Polvo’s eat and order margarita pitchers in the honor of the birthday girl. They talked. They laughed. And more margaritas were served.


Kim found herself texting Josiah and eventually decided to take the bullet. She asked the birthday girl if Josiah could join them on West 6th Street. Rebecca said yes.


After a bit of bar hopping, Josiah meets Kim, Rebecca and the rest of their friends at the Ranch, a three-story bar. Josiah was awkward in meeting Kim and her friends, but it got less and less awkward as the night went on. They talked, laughed, danced and enjoyed the night. When the clock struck 2 a.m., he walked the group to their friend Cris’ car who was the designated driver, and then went home.


The next day Kim and Rebecca were supposed to go to Plucker’s for Rebecca’s free meal, but she wanted to catch up on her sleep. Kim invited Josiah to take a walk, where they opened up completely on their fears, inspirations, and even about their family.


And since that day, Kim and Josiah became inseperable all thanks to Rebecca saying yes to a stranger crashing her birthday celebrations.[a]
