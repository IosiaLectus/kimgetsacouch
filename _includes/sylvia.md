#### Sylvia Butanda


Sylvia sat in front of Kim in 6th grade English. Little did Sylvia know that the girl who would
constantly mess with her hats (she had a big and stylish collection) would become one of her
greatest friends. Sylvia has been with Kim through it all. From surviving as freshman college
roommates in those tiny dorms at the University of Texas at Austin to late-night cry sessions
over boys to belting out Selena songs, Sylvia considers Kim an honorary sister for life.
