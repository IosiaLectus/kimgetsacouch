#### Yorgos Stratis

Yorgos and Josiah met at UT-Austin in August 2013 as first-year physics graduate students. They both quickly got in a series of discussions with topics ranging from physics to ancient Greek pronunciation. In their first year, they were both members of P-Branes and wasted multiple Saturday nights playing trivia only to find out that they had to know pop culture to do well. Since trivia did not seem to be their strong suit, they decided to start a book club and found out more than once that trying to read Godel, Escher, Bach is a daunting task that scares people away. Josiah passion for logic and science has always inspired Yorgos and in more than one occasion Yorgos has reached out to Josiah with questions. The two of them have had countless discussions about existence, consciousness, and all that jazz. Yorgos not only values Josiah as a scientist, but also as a person. In Yorgosâ€™s opinion, Josiah is an honest person with integrity who has his heart at the right place. Lastly, Josiah can always count on his friend Yorgos to be next to him during difficult situations and when they want to go for a blues-rock concert.
