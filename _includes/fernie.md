#### Fernando Carmona Jr.

Kim likes to say that everything she does is to inspire her baby brother, Fernie. Growing up wasnâ€™t easy for this pair of siblings due to their seven-year age gap. Yet, after Fernie moved to Austin, they were able to re-strengthen their sibling bond. Fernie knows that Kim will always help him figure out life, support him, and help him tease Josiah. Most importantly, he knows that Kim will always love him even after he was finally able to beat her at Mario Kart.
